# Maze Game

This is a simple maze game implemented using C++ and raylib.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have raylib installed.
2. Compile the project using your preferred C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable.

## Controls

- Arrow keys to move the player.
- `R` to reset the game.
- `F` to toggle fullscreen.
- `SPACE` to replay after winning.
- `M` to return to the menu after winning.

g++ -std=c++17 main.cpp -o MazeGame -lraylib -lstdc++

## Project Setup and Core Classes (Steps 1-20)

    Create Project Directory: Create a folder for your project (e.g., "MazeGame").

    Create Main.cpp: Create a basic main.cpp file.

    Include Raylib: #include <raylib.h>

    Basic Window Setup: Initialize a window and set a target FPS in main().

    Create Cell Class (Header): Define a Cell.h for representing a maze cell: x, y, isWall, isVisited.

    Cell Implementation (Cell.cpp): Implement Cell constructors and basic methods (e.g., render() to draw a cell).

    Create Maze Class (Header Maze.h): Declare width, height, cells (2D array of Cell objects), and methods.

    Maze Constructor (Maze.cpp): Initialize the maze grid with cells.

    Create Player Class (Header Player.h): Define x, y, speed, .

    Player Implementation (Player.cpp): Implement player movement logic.

    Integrate Player and Maze: In main(), create a Maze and Player object.

    Basic Rendering: Render the maze and player in main()'s game loop.

    Movement Test: Implement basic player movement using keyboard input.

    Collision Detection (Simple): Prevent the player from moving through walls.

    Refactor Rendering: Move rendering logic from main() into Maze::render() and Player::render().


    Game Loop Structure: Separate initialization, update, and drawing logic in main().

    Create Game Class (Header Game.h): Manage game state, difficulty, timer, etc.

    Game Implementation (Game.cpp): Implement basic game logic.

    Integrate Game Class: Use the Game class to control the game flow in main().

    Clean Up Main: main() should primarily handle window creation and running the Game instance.

# II. Maze Generation and Difficulty (Steps 21-40)

    #Maze Generation Algorithm (Research): Choose an algorithm (e.g., Recursive Backtracker, Prim's).

    #Implement Maze Generation: Add Maze::generate() to create the maze using the chosen algorithm.

    #Randomness: Use a random number generator for maze generation.

    #Test Maze Generation: Visually verify that the maze is generated correctly.

    #Difficulty Enum: Create an enum Difficulty (Easy, Medium, Hard).

    Difficulty Implementation: Modify Maze::generate() to accept a Difficulty parameter.

    Adjust Maze Size: Vary maze size based on difficulty.

    Start and End Points: Define and mark the start and end points of the maze.

    Player Starting Position: Place the player at the maze's start.

    Winning Condition: Detect when the player reaches the end.

    Display Win Message: Show a message when the player wins.

    Timer Implementation: Add a timer to the Game class.

    Display Timer: Show the elapsed time on the screen.

    Reset Game: Implement a function to reset the game and generate a new maze.

    Input for Reset: Bind a key to reset the game.

    Maze Complexity (Medium/Hard): Implement more complex maze structures for higher difficulties.

    Dead Ends (Medium/Hard): Introduce more dead ends in higher difficulty mazes.

    Loops (Hard): Add loops to the hardest difficulty.

    Refactor Maze Generation: Improve code organization and clarity.

    Test Different Difficulties: Thoroughly test all difficulty levels.

# III. User Interface and Polish (Steps 41-60)

    Menu Screen: Create a main menu with options (Start, Difficulty, Quit).

    Menu Navigation: Implement menu navigation using keyboard or mouse.

    Difficulty Selection: Allow the player to choose the difficulty from the menu.

    In-Game UI: Display relevant information (time, difficulty) during gameplay.

    Visual Improvements: Enhance the visual representation of the maze and player.

    Color Schemes: Use different colors for walls, paths, player, etc.

    Sound Effects (Optional): Add sound effects for movement, winning, etc.

    Music (Optional): Add background music.

    Animations (Optional): Add simple animations (e.g., for player movement).

    Camera Control (Optional): Implement camera following the player.

    Minimap (Optional): Display a small minimap of the maze.

    Improve Collision Detection: Refine collision handling for smoother movement.

    Code Comments: Add comments to your code for better readability.

    Code Formatting: Format your code consistently.

    Bug Fixing: Address any bugs or glitches.

    Playtesting: Have others playtest the game and provide feedback.

    Performance Optimization: Optimize code for smoother performance.

    Cross-Platform Compatibility (If needed): Test on different operating systems.

    Refactoring: Improve code structure and organization based on feedback and testing.

    Documentation: Create a basic document explaining how to build and run the game.

# IV. Optional Features and Extensions (Steps 61-80)

    Save/Load System: Implement saving and loading game progress.

    High Score System: Store and display high scores.

    Obstacles: Add obstacles to the maze (e.g., keys, doors).

    Enemies (AI): Implement simple enemy AI.

    Power-Ups: Add power-ups to enhance gameplay.

    Multiple Levels: Create multiple maze levels.

    Level Generation: Generate different levels procedurally.

    Themes: Introduce different visual themes for levels.

    Multiplayer (Challenging): Implement local or online multiplayer.

    GUI Library (Optional): Integrate a GUI library for more advanced menus.

    More Complex Animations: Add more sophisticated animations.

    Particle Effects: Implement particle effects for visual flair.

    3D Maze (Advanced): Extend the game to a 3D maze environment.

    First-Person Perspective (Advanced): Implement a first-person view.

# V. Finalization and Refinement (Steps 81-100)

    Thorough Testing: Conduct extensive testing to identify and fix all bugs.

    Performance Profiling: Profile your code to find performance bottlenecks.

    Optimization: Optimize critical sections of the code for better performance.

    Code Cleanup: Remove any unnecessary code or debug output.

    Polishing: Fine-tune gameplay and visuals for a polished experience.

    Documentation Updates: Update documentation to reflect the final version of the game.

    Packaging (Optional): Package the game for distribution.

    Version Control (Git): Use Git for version control throughout the project.

    Code Review (If possible): Have someone review your code for quality and best practices.

    Playtesting (Final): Conduct a final round of playtesting.

    Bug Fixing (Final): Fix any remaining bugs found during final testing.

    Balancing: Adjust game difficulty and parameters for a balanced and enjoyable experience.

    README File: Create a comprehensive README file for your project.

    Project Report: Write a detailed project report describing your design and implementation.

    Presentation (Optional): Prepare a presentation to showcase your game.

    Reflection: Reflect on the development process and identify areas for improvement.

    Future Enhancements: Plan for potential future enhancements or features.

    Open Source (Optional): Consider releasing your project as open-source.

    Portfolio: Add the project to your portfolio.
